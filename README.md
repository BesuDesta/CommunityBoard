## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I had trouble parsing data from JSON file.
I asked a friend what might have been wrong and found out that it didn't need to be a string so then I could export without parsing.
Also had trouble with accessing images from assets folder so I moved all images to public folder.
